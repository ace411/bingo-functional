A simple functional programming library for PHP.

## Requirement(s)

- PHP 7 or higher

## Rationale

PHP, a language not commonly associated with Functional Programming, does support the paradigm - to an extent. The language's Functional Programming affability though substantial is not the same as that of Haskell, OCaml, or F# - purely Functional languages. bingo-functional is an attempt at enhancing the usability of FP techniques - those that warrant the use of helper functions, applicatives, monads, pattern matching, and immutable lists.

## Documentation

Please check out the [documentation](https://bingo-functional-docs.now.sh) for more knowledge on how to use this library.

Also, a [changelog](https://github.com/ace411/bingo-functional/blob/master/README.md) exists and can be used to track changes made to the project.

## Dealing with problems

Endeavor to create an issue on GitHub when the need arises or send an email to lochbm@gmail.com

## Functional Programming in PHP

I published a book titled - Functional Programming in PHP - which is currently available on LeanPub. The bingo-functional library features extensively in the text as a tool whose potencies demonstrate usage of Functional Programming ideas in PHP. I advise that you purchase a copy for $9.99.
